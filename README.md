# Simulator

Introduction
● This project, required us to design and implement a custom assembler and a custom 
simulator for a given ISA.
● We were not restricted to any programming language. However, our program had to
read from stdin and write to stdout.
● We needed to write our code in the directories described in the README file.
● We also had to track our changes via Github.
● Committing our code to the repository periodically to prevent any loss of code due to 
system failures or any other issues was an important part of the project.

PARTS:
1. Designing and Implementing the assembler.
2. Designing and Implementing the simulator.

For 1 and 2:
1. Assembler: The test cases are divided into 3 sets:
   a. ErrorGen: These tests are supposed to generate errors
   b. simpleBin: These are simple test cases which are supposed to generate a binary.
   c. hardGen: These are hard test cases which are supposed to generate a binary.

2. Simulator: The test cases are divided into 2 sets:
   a. simpleBin: These are simple test cases which are supposed to generate a trace.
   b. hardGen: These are hard test cases which are supposed to generate a trace.
